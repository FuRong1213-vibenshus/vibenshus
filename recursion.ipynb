        "The broad goal of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies so that engineers change one area of software without impacting others. Additionally, they’re intended to make designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Ultimately, using these design principles makes it easier for software engineers to avoid issues and to build adaptive, effective, and agile software.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the principles come with many benefits, following the principles generally leads to writing longer and more complex code. This means that it can extend the design process and make development a little more difficult. However, this extra time and effort is well worth it because it makes software so much easier to maintain, test, and extend.\n",

        "> **Single Responsibility Principle**\n",
        "\n",
        "Robert Martin summarizes this principle well by mandating that, “a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.” Following this principle means that each class only does one thing and every class or module only has responsibility for one part of the software’s functionality. More simply, each class should solve only one problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Utilizing this principle makes code easier to test and maintain, it makes software easier to implement, and it helps to avoid unanticipated side-effects of future changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can avoid these problems by asking a simple question before you make any changes: What is the responsibility of your class/component/microservice?\n",
        "\n",
        "If your answer includes the word “and”, you’re most likely breaking the single responsibility principle. Then it’s better to take a step back and rethink your current approach. There is most likely a better way to implement it.\n",
